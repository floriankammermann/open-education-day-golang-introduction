# Agenda

1. Introduction
2. golang Introduction
3. Explore LiteIDE with go hello world
4. Explain Webserver
5. Create basic Webserver with example

# Golang 

## History

* 2007 Start of Design at google
* 2009 Public Announcement
* 2012 Version 1.0
* 2019 Version 1.12

## Who uses it

* off course google
* docker
* kubernetes
* many other infrastructure tools
* more and more in Enterprise Development

---

# Golang 

## Why golang

* Simplicity
* Tooling built in 
* no Virtual Machine
* Very good parallel support (multicore)
* Performance (memory/cpu)

---

# Golang

## Experiment with golang

[play.golang.org](https://play.golang.org/)

---

# LiteIDE

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
 fmt.Println("I'm coding")
}
```

# Create basic webserver

```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "net/http"
)
```

* Go has a lot of already built in functionality.
* The `net/http` package is such built in functionality.
* It contains all the necessary stuff to create http servers and clients.

---

# Create basic webserver

```go
func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

This is a handler which can be used by the golang http server
* `http.Request` contains all the information about the HTTP Request  
* `http.ResponseWriter` is used to write the answer too  

---

# Create basic webserver

```go
http.HandleFunc("/", func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello I'm a http server")
})
```

We register the handler to the http package (http server) and tell the http package to use it for the path `/`.  
We write some string to ResponseWriter, which will be sent back to the client.

---

# Create basic webserver

```go
http.ListenAndServe(":8088", nil)
```

Here we start the http server on port 8088.  
At this point we have an http sever, which handles requests to `/`.

---

# Create basic webserver

```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "net/http"
)

func main() {
 http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello I'm a http server")
 })

 http.ListenAndServe(":8088", nil)
}
```

---

# Bonus Points

* create 2 functions, each one sleeps 5 sec. Call them in sequence in the handler.
* Expected behaviour: the request takes 10sec to response
* let the functions run in go routines
* Expected behaviour: the request takes 5sec
* let every function return a string. Use [channels](https://gobyexample.com/channels). Return the function return values in the reponse.
* Expected behaviour: the request takes 5sec and shows the results of both functions

---

# Custom Response

Implement for different path a custom response:
* `/greeting` "This is a greeter"
* `/greeting/CH` "This is a greeter for Switzerlan"
* `/greeting/CH/de` "Gr√ºezi"
* `/greeting/CH/fr` "Bonjour"
* `/greeting/CH/it` "Ciao"

---

# Bonuspoint

* create a function greet which takes the greeting text as an argument
* use this function to map a rout to the return value

---

# Create a datastructure with the rivers of switzerland

* we need a structure to hold the data: key, name, length

```go
type River struct {
 Key        string
 Name       string
 LengthInKM int
}
```

---

# Create a map of River with the data

* map is a datastructure with key/value
* value can be everyting
* we need to initalize the map
* data from [wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Fl%C3%BCsse_in_der_Schweiz)

```go
 rivers := make(map[string]River)
 rivers["rhein"] = River{Key: "rhein", Name: "Rhein", LengthInKM: 1238}
```

---

# Extract the last path element and return the according river

* route the path `/river/`
* extract last path element with 
```
path.Base(r.URL.String())
```
* get the river from the map and return name and length 
```
fmt.Fprintf(w, "Name: %s, Length in km: %d", river.Name, river.LengthInKM)
```

---

# Bonuspoint

* create a json file with the rivers
* read the json file from the code

---

# Pass max/min length as parameter and return the according river

* `/river/?minlength=300&maxlength=500`

---

# Congratulations
